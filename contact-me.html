  <h1>My Contacts</h1>
  <p>Contact lenses are thin lenses worn directly on the eye to correct vision problems like nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia. 
    They can be soft (hydrogel or silicone hydrogel), rigid gas permeable (RGP), or specialized designs such as scleral and cosmetic lenses.
  </p>
  <p>The idea dates back to Leonardo da Vinci in 1508, but practical lenses weren’t developed until the late 1800s, when Adolf Fick and F.A. Müller created glass scleral 
    lenses. These early versions were heavy and uncomfortable. In the 20th century, plastics replaced glass, corneal lenses became smaller and more wearable, and by the 
    1970s soft hydrogel lenses revolutionized comfort. The 1980s–90s saw disposable lenses, and today’s silicone hydrogel contacts allow more oxygen flow, with options 
    ranging from daily disposables to cosmetic and even experimental smart lenses.

  <p>Summarized by ChatGPT. And yes, I am wearing these contact lenses right now!</p>
  <p>Oh wait, you meant <strong>contacts</strong>, not <em>contacts...</em></p>
