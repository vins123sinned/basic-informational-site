# basic-informational-site
A basic informational site built using Node.js. This is my first Node project as well!

As my first Node.js project, this site is very minimal and only focuses on creating a Node server and serving the correct pages according to the specified url. The user is able to see the index page and go to any existing pages as well. In the case of an invalid url path, an error 404 page is generated that tells the user about the wrong path. All in all, it's a simple project but sets the foundation for bigger and better projects in the future. As they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/basic-informational-site.git

```bash
cd basic-informational-site
```

- Start the Node server

```bash
