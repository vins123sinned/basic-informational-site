  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! If you saw any of my other projects where I introduced myself, then hello, again! The name's Vinson, 
    and throughout every single project my passion still stands with programming. The internet was and is a big part of my life,
    from when I first got an iPad when I was a kid to now starting Node.js again after a really long hiatus.
  </p>
  <p>I can't really explain it right now, but something just feels <em>right</em> programming and I've never once hated doing this stuff. While there
    were definitely times that I've procrastinated it was usually just a bad trait of mine and nothing to do with not wanting to code or program. There is a lot that
    I would love to talk about with programming and myself, but I want to finish this project relatively quick so I can move on to more interesting and greater projects.
    All in all, I would like to express my gratitude for the internet, programming, online gaming, and everything that happened in my life to lead me here. The future may seem uncertain,
    But I know that if I follow my passion and desire I will get wherever I need to be, and I hope that you too can experience peace, joy, harmony, love, and all the goods things in your
    life. It's a bit late as I'm writing this so I'll keep it short: I sincerely hope with all of my heart you are doing great right now, whoever is reading this (even programs!), and I wish 
    you a great rest of your life and eternity onwards! Goodbye!
  </p>
